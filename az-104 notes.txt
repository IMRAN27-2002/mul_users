	***	AZ-104 AZURE ADMINISTRATOR	***
-- In azure, Budgets used to get email alerts for budget increase than expected

-- Azure shared disks - allows a managed disk to be attached to mul. VM's
   concept is, can attach disk to mul. vm's but data in os layer 
   not reflects on other vm from 1st vm stored data
-- we can run custom scripts in vm with extensions and selecting file from the storage acc.
cloud init -- to install packages on a linux VM
-- Boot diagnostics (Monitoring tab) - gives log details of failures
-- Run cmd(vm-->settings) - to run scripts remotely

-- Azure Dedicated Hosts
This service provides physical servers to host virtual machines. 
The physical server is dedicate to the Azure subscription.

The benefits of Azure Dedicated Hosts is that no other virtual machines 
from any other customers would be placed on the physical server.

-- Availability zone -> phy. loc. within azure region made up of 1 or more data centers 

VM Scale Sets --> gr. of vm's to scale up or down vm's hosting app.'s

$ sudo app-get install stress --> makes the load onto vm

$ sudo stress --cpu 1000 --> makes the cpu size increase

Image - copy of full VM includes data disks or OS disk

In networking --> capture --> create an image

** proximity placement group --> for making vm's closer to each other
	(present in ADV. sec of vm creation)
Deployment Slots -- to keep changes intact and update can create diff. slots 
eg: if 2 versions are there then can have prod. slot, Staging slot 
-- to use deploy. slots must have standard or higher like premium versions

-- with Standard feature can use Auto-Scaling

-- by Disassociating the public IP addr.eg: we can't reach the server running in vm created 

-- can publish file from v studio to web app

-- achieve without public ip access using VNet Integration

-- using custom domains can allocate own domain name to azure web app

-- Backup service can add backups using custom backup linking to the st. acc.


	**	VNet	**
In a Subnet mask, 255.255.255.0 -->0 is for hostname & 255.255.255 is network ID

-- there are 256 total no. of hosts , 254 are usable
-- 192.0.2.0 for network id & 192.0.2.255 for broadcast id
-- for subnet mask - 255.255.255.0  we have 192.0.2.0/24 -- 8+8+8=24 -- last digit for hosts
-- for subnet mask - 255.255.0.0 we have    192.0.2.0/16 -- 8+8=16 -- last 2 digits for hosts

** In Subnet, we can make boundary for making diff. app. in VM run on each subnet in a VNet
   for comm. b/w subnets, security for each subnet can be given
   
-- can't delete a subnet if a VM linked to it

-- can add NIC to VM when VM is in deallocated state / stop

-- NSG -> for Inbound & Outbound traffics
-- In NSG, we have priority no. by which each rule given order of priority

-- subnet-nsg comes first when network-nsg is also there

-- NAT (Network Address Translator) rules for connecting to VM using 
   public IP in NAT rule along with  

Frontend IP, Backend IP-- ?

-- Azure Application Gateway --> manage traffic on web app
 
-- VNet Peering -- for 2 VNet's to comm. it is used
-- VPN -> for privacy of what we are connecting to internet from laptop/system

-- point to site vpn --> connect small no. of machines to Azure VNet
-- site to site vpn --> connect machines of on-premises to Azure VNet

-- can generate self-signed root certificate using PowerShell

** For Site-to-Site connection we apply in Add connection of Vnetwork-gateway 

-- Virtual WAN hub, can be used to connect on-premise to vnet without having VNet Gateway
-- ExpressRoute --> don;t go over public Internet
-- user defined route --> if there are 3 subnets then one vm can comm. to dest. VM 
   in between there is central VM

-- Network Watcher 
   --> Next hop tool for telling how packets route
** Azure Firewall --> can login to vm using DNAT rule through firewall Public IP with port no.

-- through azure we can add DNS records using DNS Zone and specify DNS domain bought
   to connect to DNS Zone for getting connected to vm which was specified by a record

-- Azure Storage Explorer tool --> for managing storage acc.
 eg: if employees need to work with only st. acc. then can use st. explorer

-- access st. acc. --> 
- Access Keys
  has connection string used in .net programs for st. acc. access
- SAS (Shared Access Signature) not only at blob level also at storage level 
- Azure AD Authentication --> for access to employee in an org. best method

** Redundant Storage
-- LRS - 3 copies in one data center
-- ZRS - 3 az's has copies
-- GRS - 2 regions each have 3 copies like LRS
-- Read-access GRS - here 2ndary region also can be accessed at same time 
		     but in GRS only access is made to 2ndary when primary region fails 
-- Geo-zone-redundant st. -- here we have 1 copy in 3 az's each and 2ndary has copies as LRS
-- Read Access geo-zone-redundant st. -- we can access this even without 1st region fail

-- Access tiers - Hot (more st. cost, less access cost),
		  Cool (low st. cost, high access cost),
		  Archive (low st.cost, high access cost than cool tier)
-- can use life cycle management in st. acc. for making rules to check blob access tiers and 
   make transition to respective tiers

-- In st. acc. , in Data protection can set blob versioning
-- Object replication --> to copy blobs from src st. acc. to dest. acc.

** Fileshare --> for having a fileserver for each emp. of an org. 
-  we can connect fileshare to local system by running code in power shell
-  we can connect local system to fileshare using Map Network Drive option
   using url to link

** IE enhanced security configuration --> is off that helps to install software on VM

** Azure AD --> identity provider, users, groups created
-- Through RBAC (Role Based Access Control) to assign to users certain resource permissions

** can create Dynamic Groups using Dynamic Queries with properties
-- can add Custom Domain using Azure AD then use them for the users while creating
-- while creating VM in Management section, can enable login with AD for joining VM to AD

** we can add External guest user to Azure AD also

-- create a Bulk create for many users using template 

-- can have per user MFA enabled 
-- Through "Conditional Access" we can enable MFA using conditions --> for Azure AD Premium license 

-- Resource Tags --> can be used for filtering, can't be inherited to resources in a RG
-- Resource Locks --> 
   2 types -- 1. read only 2. Delete 
-- Azure Ploicies --> Like only allow certain regions for certain RG's
